# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 5, 2020
##### Trello clone project 

**Today's Progress**: Implemented most of the remaining functionality for the Trello board. 

**Thoughts:** I've really enjoyed doing this project and proud to see how far the team have taken this considering we're only week 4 into the bootcamp. I'm still trying to figure out how to fix a few lingering bugs with the `addEventListeners` being applied.
